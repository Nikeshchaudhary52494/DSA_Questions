# Greddy problems:
1. Assign-cookie: Sort the array and use 2 pointers
2. Lemonade: Get track of the bills and use bigger bills first
3. Jump-Game: Check the maximum Index that can be reached
4. Jump-Gane2: Solve using recurssion bt trying all possible ways and then Optimise it using DP ||  solve it by finding the Range that can be reached in jumps
5. Fractional-Knapsack: solve it using considering profilt/weight

# Sorting algorithms:
1. Selection: Select the miniMum or maxiMum element from the array and swap with the starting index

# Bit manipulation:
1. DecimalToBinary: find remainder using num%2 and add to string then num/2.
2. BinaryToDecimal: traverse from right to left, calculate base and add to the num.
3. SwapTwoNum: swap two numbers uaing XOR as a^a = 0 -> a^b^a = b 
4. SetOrUnSet: use formula (num & (i<<i)) with left shift and ((num>>i) & i) with right shift operator, if result = 0 then unset else set as 0 & 1 = 0.
